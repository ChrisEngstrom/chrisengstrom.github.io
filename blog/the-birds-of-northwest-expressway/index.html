                    <p>So right when we moved in we noticed a couple of barn swallows started to build a nest of mud. Instead of being jerks we figured we would let them build their nest.</p>
<p>We grew kind of attached to them and it was kinda cool to see them swoop in as you are walking out and such. Well soon enough we noticed they had laid eggs and were kind of excited about it.</p>
<p>Not much longer and we noticed the mom hanging around the nest a little more and then she was gone. But in her stead we heard the little chirps of baby birds. It was really neat to be able to see them as we were leaving for work and then again when we got back.</p>
<p>They grew fast and their parents were there less and less. We only saw them when they were there to feed the little ones. The mom was pretty protective, but I think she was use to us. If she was there when we walked by she would hid the little guys from us and actually stay in the nest the whole time.</p>
<p>I kind of wish she would have known that we werenâ€™t going to harm them but it was still really cool to see her care for her babies like that. This is my favorite picture of them because they just got their fluffy feathers and it made them look way bigger than they actually were haha.</p>
<p>They kept growing and growing. They would always stare at us and get really quiet whenever we passed, but as soon as we got down the stairs I would hear them start chirping again because they werenâ€™t quite big enough to go get their own food yet.</p>
<p>I think it was the morning of this picture that I really go the feeling that they were going to fly that day. They had been getting really close to the edge of the nest for some time now but just hadnâ€™t tried yet. And sure enough once we got back that day they were all gone.</p>
<p>They still come back from time to time. Weâ€™ll here them squawking sometimes during the day, but mostly at night. It is a bit louder now than before though lol.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m glad we let them keep their home there, despite the mound of birdie doo doo they left in the corner right by our door. That can be cleaned though ðŸ™‚</p>
