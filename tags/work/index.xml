      <description>It’s weird to look back a week ago and think about how much has changed since then. For those of you who don’t know, I recently made the decision to leave T&amp;amp;S and join the ColorfulStudio crew.
Recently I have been considering whether or not T&amp;amp;S is the right company for me. I love the people that work there and the environment of the company, don’t get me wrong, but when you are thinking about your career and where you want it to go in the future you have to take a step back every once in a while and look at what your goals are for yourself and if you will be able to achieve them at your current job.</description>
