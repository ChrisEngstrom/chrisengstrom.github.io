      <description>It’s weird to look back a week ago and think about how much has changed since then. For those of you who don’t know, I recently made the decision to leave T&amp;amp;S and join the ColorfulStudio crew.
Recently I have been considering whether or not T&amp;amp;S is the right company for me. I love the people that work there and the environment of the company, don’t get me wrong, but when you are thinking about your career and where you want it to go in the future you have to take a step back every once in a while and look at what your goals are for yourself and if you will be able to achieve them at your current job.</description>

      <description>When working with JavaScript or jQuery it is important to remember to check and make sure that the basic functionality is working correctly before you get frustrated and upset that absolutely NOTHING is working.
Recently I was working on a project at work and no matter what I did with my jQuery statements, I couldn’t get anything to work. I was looking at examples online and making sure mine was following the same concept but still nothing was working.</description>

      <description>Intro While I was at work the other day we received an update request from a client. Since I saw it first I assigned it to myself and started to work at it. There were only two things that the client wanted us to change. The first was changing the suite number for a particular address, which took about five seconds to track down and change. The second was that he wanted to post a job on their careers page.</description>
