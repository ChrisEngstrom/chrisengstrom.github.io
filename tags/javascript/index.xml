      <description>When working with JavaScript or jQuery it is important to remember to check and make sure that the basic functionality is working correctly before you get frustrated and upset that absolutely NOTHING is working.
Recently I was working on a project at work and no matter what I did with my jQuery statements, I couldnâ€™t get anything to work. I was looking at examples online and making sure mine was following the same concept but still nothing was working.</description>

      <description>While I was at work the other day we received an update request from a client. Since I saw it first I assigned it to myself and started to work at it. There were only two things that the client wanted us to change. The first was changing the suite number for a particular address, which took about five seconds to track down and change. The second was that he wanted to post a job on their careers page.</description>
