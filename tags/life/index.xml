      <description>So right when we moved in we noticed a couple of barn swallows started to build a nest of mud. Instead of being jerks we figured we would let them build their nest. We grew kind of attached to them and it was kinda cool to see them swoop in as you are walking out and such. Well soon enough we noticed they had laid eggs and were kind of excited about it.</description>
