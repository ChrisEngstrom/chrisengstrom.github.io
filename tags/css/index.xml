      <description>Many pages that I have seen that are organized pretty well have horizontal menus, so I want to teach myself how to do them and get good at it. My alterior motive to writing this post is that I need one of these to use for a jQuery post I originally planned on doing before this but forgot the css code back at work. So here I am about to do it again but this time understand it better than I did the first time.</description>

      <description>While I was at work the other day we received an update request from a client. Since I saw it first I assigned it to myself and started to work at it. There were only two things that the client wanted us to change. The first was changing the suite number for a particular address, which took about five seconds to track down and change. The second was that he wanted to post a job on their careers page.</description>
