      <description>The news of Alltel in my area being bought out by Verizon had me quite excited when I had first heard about it. At that time the Google Nexus One was just about to be released and I didnâ€™t know there was going to be a correlation. Soon after I had heard Alltel was getting bought out I also found out that the Google Nexus One would be coming to Verizon in the Spring of 2010!</description>
